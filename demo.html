        Video is and will continue to be a huge part of content marketing: 
            According to Cisco, 80% of web traffic will be video by 2019. That's a lot.
            And this same sentiment is reflected in the latest report from HubSpot Research,
            where 45% of survey respondents admitted to watching 1+ hours of video on 
            Facebook and YouTube each week.

            To further illustrate this point, let's consider that users watch 8 billion videos on 
            Facebook and 10 billion videos on Snapchat per day. Today, social media platforms are 
            becoming more about content sharing and discovery, so an integrated video and social 
            media strategy will be necessary for brands seeking to compete. (Learn more about 
            creating video for social media in our free ebook.)
